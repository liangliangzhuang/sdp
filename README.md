# sdp (Stochastic degradation process)

## Introduction

Degradation models have become an essential tool for analyzing complex systems. Over the last two decades, several degradation models have been developed to capture the degradation dynamics of systems and facilitate decision-making processes. This paper aims to provide practical guidance on the statistical analysis of common degradation processes to help engineers evaluate products effectively. 

The paper introduces three commonly used degradation models: the Wiener process, the Gamma process, and the Inverse Gaussian process. For each degradation process, the paper covers data simulation generation, statistical inference, and remaining useful life prognostics. 

In summary, this paper provides engineers with practical guidance on how to analyze data using common degradation models. It is hoped that this paper will contribute to the development of more accurate and reliable degradation models that can be used to improve product evaluation and decision-making processes in various industries.
